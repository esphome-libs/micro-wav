"""Include-what-you-use checker built on clang-include-cleaner.

Checks that every source and header directly includes what it uses, with one
family-specific relaxation: a foo.cpp may rely on headers its matching foo.h
already includes directly (the pair is maintained together, so restating the
header's includes in the cpp is churn without benefit).

ESP32 handling: library code keeps ESP-IDF includes behind #ifdef ESP_PLATFORM
or in ESP-only directories, which host tooling normally can't parse. Instead
of cross-compiling, each file is analyzed up to twice -- a host pass with no
extra defines (ESP branches are preprocessed away) and an ESP pass with
-DESP_PLATFORM plus materialized stub headers on the include path (host-only
branches are preprocessed away; see esp_stubs.py). The stubs declare just the ESP-IDF symbols this
library family uses; their file names match the real headers, so symbol
attribution resolves to the same include line a real ESP-IDF build would want.

Escape hatches: the engine honors IWYU pragmas (// IWYU pragma: keep, export,
private). sdkconfig.h is never reported: its CONFIG_* macros are invisible to
usage analysis when unset in the default configuration.

Known limitation: the engine never suggests removing C-compatibility headers
(<cstring>, <cstdint>, ...), only pure C++ ones -- an unused <cstring> goes
unreported. It errs toward false negatives; anything it does report is real.

Usage: check_includes.py [--fix]
  --fix  apply unused-include removals in place (missing includes are always
         reported for manual fixing; automatic insertion cannot honor the
         matching-header relaxation). Edits are applied only after every
         analysis completes, and a host+esp dual-checked file is only edited
         when both passes agree on the removals.

Requires clang-include-cleaner (apt: clang-tools-18, brew: llvm).
